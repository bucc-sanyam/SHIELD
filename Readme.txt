The problem we are referring to :
The manpower required for surveillance of CCTV videos of public places is inadequate and ineffective.

About our project in brief :
We plan to create an AI-powered system to detect any harassment or other violations using real-time image recognition and raise alarm for the incident. This will decrease the time of action and increase effectiveness of CCTV surveillance.

About our project in detail:
Humans are more prone to mistakes and laziness, but women safety is a field where no mistakes can be tolerated. Using this project we can automate the current surveillance system, which will be less dependent on manpower. The images captured by CCTV camera will be processed, using AI, suspected images will create an alert and then further actions will be taken. The main aim is to provide workers a safe environment rather than having a feared one. No earning is expected from this project rather helping people and creating a safer world. 

# The attached files contains a python code, which uses AI to process an image and give an output score. This score can be used to detect harassment. Whenever, harassment is detected we can raise alarm, or inform police and authorities
